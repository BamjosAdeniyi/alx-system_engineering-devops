DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration and efficiency in the software development lifecycle. It aims to bridge the gap between development teams and operations teams by promoting communication, automation, and shared responsibilities.
The goal of DevOps is to deliver software applications more rapidly, reliably, and consistently, while maintaining high quality and stability. It involves integrating various stages of the software development process, including planning, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
